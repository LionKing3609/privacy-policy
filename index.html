<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Tum Tum Shaur Horror Game</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Erik</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
</p>

<h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
